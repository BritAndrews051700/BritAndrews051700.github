<p> <p>My name is Britney Andrews and I have a sixth month old maltese puppy. I got Kaylie from a breeder in Milo, Maine on my birthday in May. Kaylie weighed two pounds when I got her and was very shy. She is now full of energy and is almost 4 pounds!</p>



<p>
    These are just some random cute pictures of Kaylie over the last 6 months!

<p>The first day I had Kaylie we went to my highschool in Ellsworth so that my friends and teachrs could meet Kaylie. After visting my former highschool, I brought Kaylie home so she could meet our two other maltese dogs, Noah and Bo.
